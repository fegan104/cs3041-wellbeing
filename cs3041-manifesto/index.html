          Design For Tension
        </a>
      </h1>
      <div class="text-body">
        To tackle designing for tension we developed a chatbot using the Flow XO platform that is designed to bridge the tense gap
        between those who love pineapple on their pizza and those who view it as blasphemous. Our bot is able to inquire
        about the person’s personal taste, offer recipes, and deliver high quality memes.
        </p>
        Once we were able to understand our users and their input, and created a design flow we brought it all together to create
        our chatbot using Flow XO. We implemented 7 different flows that are interconnected to serve as different aspects
        of the branches shown in the design flow sketch. Each additional chatbot messages and responses were all based off
        triggers. With the time frame we had, we connected each of the 7 flows to make conversations seem natural and intertwined.
        The message that the chatbot outputs would be triggered based off of the users choice response they chose.

        We are noticing a trend now where technology is incorporated in most aspects of our lives. Devices have helped us communicate
        with people around the globe, increased our productivity, and assisted us in accessing data in an instant. What has
        not been taken into account for such technologies is the wellbeing of the user. A phone can remind us of when to
        take medicine, go to the gym or attend a meeting, but they do not advise about measures to be taken when the user
        is not feeling up to par. We as designers have been tasked to use technology in a way that would consider the user’s
        emotions and react to support them.
        </p>
        As a learning opportunity the Design for Wellbeing provided an introduction into the world of affective technology. From
        the initial brainstorm to the final rendition, our product exists as an example of the future. One day machines will
        not be limited to only analyzing general human emotion but will retain the capacity to detect smaller alterations
        of expression and tones of voice. Technology will not advance to erase humanity with robotic existence but rather
        embrace it to supplement the human experience.

        My team and I worked with one another in order to map data with the goal of communicating information with two different
        lenses in mind: clear communication and reasoning, and persuasive communication and storytelling. The first lens,
        clear communication and reasoning aims to portray a clear, in-depth, and unbiased representation of the data. The
        second lens, persuasive communication and storytelling, aims to frame the data in a compelling way.

        My team redesigned Worcester public library’s website to make it both mobile optimized, and designed specifically
        for non-profit groups. Our redesign focuses on making room reservations and equipment rentals a more streamlined
        process. Additionally, we added emphasis to the community oriented aspect of the library by making the mission statement
        and library’s vision more accessible.
